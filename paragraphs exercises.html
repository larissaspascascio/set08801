			<h1> HEALTH CARE GLOBAL NEWS </h1>
			<h3> While the holidays continue to bring family and friends together over the coming weeks, this time of year also typically heightens the potential exposure to respiratory infections, like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19. Taking proactive measures to limit the spread of these viruses helps safeguard communities and keep people healthy throughout the holiday season.

				Fortunately, pharmacies, physicians and health systems offer a wide range of products and services for patient care â€“ from immunizations that guard against infection to rapid diagnostic tests that deliver important results to clinicians in minutes.

				Through our robust distribution network and solutions capabilities, Cardinal Health is proud to work with these providers, enabling access to the right products at the right time to treat their patients with safe, quality care during respiratory season. </h3>

				Focused on the importance of influenza vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced National Influenza Vaccination Week in 2005, observed in December. Today, vaccinations are available for influenza, pneumonia, RSV and COVID-19; the CDC recommends people stay up to date on vaccinations for seasonal respiratory viruses. </h5>
