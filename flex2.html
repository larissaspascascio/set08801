                <p> Successful change-agile leaders at all levels in the organization
                     respond to changes in the business environment by seizing opportunities, including 
                     throwing out old models and developing new ways of doing business.
                      They try to make change thinking contagious, embedding it into everything they do 
                      from the most fundamental daily interactions to the most complex strategy. 
                      Change-agile leaders demonstrate several integrated behaviors that, together,
                       create a competitive advantage for the organization. They share a compelling, 
                       clear purpose with employees. They look ahead and see new opportunities.  
                       They create a safe psychological space for teams to discuss the challenges of working 
                       together and of the integration overall. They promote calculated risk-taking and experimentation, 
                       and encourage cross-boundary collaborations to build products, attract customers, and achieve results.
